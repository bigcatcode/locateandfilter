LocateAndFilter is a versatile and highly customizable WordPress plugin aimed at creating nice looking searchable/filterable maps.

**Friendly**

LocateAndFilter has been built on the great library LeafletJs (http://leafletjs.com/) and coded with extensibility in mind : addons using LocateAndFilter in conjunction with another WP plugin. You no longer need Google API Key

**Use just any
taxonomy as a filter**

Easily use any
taxonomy (custom taxonomies or regular taxonomies) to filter your
maps.

**Supports Custom
Post Types**

Most of the
WordPress plugins only support posts and pages. Not this plugin!
Total support for any custom post type and their taxonomies!

**Fully
customizable marker icons**

You can define a
custom marker icon for each location or choose to use the same marker
for the whole map. It’s up to you!

Choose between the
plugin’s predefined marker icons, create your own markers using
Ionicon or just use any image from the media library. Total
flexibility!

**Customizable Map
Overlay**

Choose between 4
different map overlays… Or use any overlay you want with the Custom
Overlay Addon

**Additional fields**

Need to display a
specific info on the map? Create additional fields! Additional fields
are custom fields specifically designed to be displayed on the map.

Let’s say your map
is about coffeshops and you want to show the opening hours and the
name of the nearest subway station? Create 2 additional fields :
openingHours and nearestSubway. Done! Those informations are ready to
be displayed in the marker list and the tooltips.

**Fully
customizable tooltips**

Customize the
tooltips EXACTLY as you want them : HTML, audios, videos, images,post
content… Tooltips can display nearly anything.

Customize the
tooltip template for each marker independently, you have total
control on the information that appears…or use a tooltip preset for
instant styling!

**Fully
customizable marker list**

Customize the marker
list as you please : HTML, audios, videos, images,post content…

**Ready to use**

Need a map NOW?
choose a map Layout, click, you are done!

Not exactly what you
had in mind? No worries!Just edit the layout CSS directly in the
admin!

**Robust**

LocateAndFilter has
been tested with 10 000 markers containing images, videos and
audio…and still ran smoothly

**Responsive &
Touch optimized**

**And many other
features…**

Additional control layers 
by Bing satellite 
and Yandex satellite

Detection of user’s
location
